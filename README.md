# Memory Allocation Strategy Game

This is an educational mini-game designed to help students better understand **operating system memory allocation strategies**:  
- First-Fit  
- Next-Fit  
- Best-Fit  
- Worst-Fit  

## 🎮 Game Description

Players begin by selecting one of the four memory allocation strategies.  
The game will simulate 20 predefined processes with various memory requirements (both large and small).  

The system dynamically allocates memory blocks according to the selected strategy.  
At the end, the player will see a performance summary based on:

- ✅ Allocation success rate  
- ⚡️ Time efficiency  
- 📊 Memory utilization  
- 🔧 Fragmentation rate  

## 🎨 UI Style

The interface follows a **simple Ghibli-style design** — soft colors, clear visuals, and a gentle atmosphere to make learning fun and engaging.

## 💡 Features

- Interactive memory block simulation  
- Visualization of real-time allocation behavior  
- Comparison across different strategies  
- Modular structure for future enhancements  

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS (custom + open-source icons)  
- JavaScript
